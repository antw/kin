===

Kin contains a number of components extracted from Showcase which are suitable
for reuse in other applications. At the moment, included in this Gem are:

  Kin::Form
    A custom form builder which extends Merb's default. Adds support for
    date_field, time_field and datetime_field. Also included is a tweaked
    label which will add span.req around asterisks, and span.note around text
    which is in parenthesis.

  Kin::Nav
    Allows for easily building tabbed navigation, selecting active tabs,
    linking to resources, and guarding tabs from those without sufficient
    permission.

  Kin::Masthead
    Creates the mastheads used in Showcase which contains the page title, and
    other various details.
