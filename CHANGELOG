== 0.2.0 2009-08-22

* Renamed gem from Potion to Kin.
* Added kin.js from Torque project.
* SASS stylesheets will no longer be added to the SASS load path, rather you
  should use `rake kin:copy_assets` to copy Kin's SASS and javascripts to your
  application.
* Navigation configuration will be autoloaded from navigation.rb in your
  application's config directory (Merb.dir_for(:config)).
* Added Kin::Configurable which replaces application-specific #config and
  #configure methods.
